Hi. My name is Tomi, I’m a highly-motivated technical writer and front end developer who’s able to translate designs into clean and beautiful websites that work. I’m passionate about words that motivate and educate, so I love to create helpful content on tech, especially for beginners.
My hobbies are all over the place. I love to watch movies, listen to music and hang out with friends.
